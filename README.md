# Codebase Expansion Project 2
### CSCI-B453 Game Development
### Indiana University Bloomington Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering

This assignment tasked us with adding features to, optimizing/refactoring, or otherwise building on an existing game. The game I chose was [Twilight Gal](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2022/games/twilight-gal-1), a game submitted for the 2022 Global Game Jam. The game is a 2D/3D puzzle platformer that uses shadows and the interplay between 2D and 3D space to create puzzles.

I built on the game by adding a moveable light object to the game that can create new shadows of varying sizes or remove shadows by shining light on the wall where the shadow would be. I added a new level to showcase this new feature.
