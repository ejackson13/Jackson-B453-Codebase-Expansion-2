# Codebase Expansion Project 2
### CSCI-B453 Game Development
### Indiana University Bloomington Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering

This assignment tasked us with adding features to, optimizing/refactoring, or otherwise building on an existing game. The game I chose was [Twilight Gal](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2022/games/twilight-gal-1), a game submitted for the 2022 Global Game Jam. The game is a 3D puzzle platformer that uses light and shadows to create puzzles.

I built on the game by adding a feature where the size of the shadow would grow based on the distance from the light source and added a few new levels to showcase this feature.
